# HelpApp 
HelpApp is our effort towards creating an application which people can use to communicate when there is no internet. This application is created for disaster struck areas where communication can play a vital role in saving human lives but it can also be used in various scenarios.
It is a android chatting app which creates a mesh network of mobiles. Mobiles can interact with each other without connecting  to the internet.
Help was created using Kotlin as its base language with a little Java for the database code.
